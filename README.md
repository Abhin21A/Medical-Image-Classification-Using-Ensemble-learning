#  Medical Image Classification using Ensemble Learning (ResNet50 + Voting Classifier)

This project applies **ensemble learning** to medical image classification by combining the power of **deep learning (ResNet50)** with traditional ensemble techniques like **VotingClassifier**. It showcases how modern CNN models can be enhanced through ensemble strategies for improved performance and robustness.

##  Objective

- Perform classification of medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs).
- Use ResNet50 for feature extraction.
- Combine predictions using an ensemble method (Voting Classifier).

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Ensemble Methods (Voting Classifier)
